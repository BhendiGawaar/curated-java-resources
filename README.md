# Curated Java Learning Resources

A [curated and annotated list of resources][resources] for learning Java programming.

  [resources]: https://github.com/BhendiGawaar/curated-java-resources/blob/master/resources.md

## Motivation and goals

There is a huge number of resources and tutorials
available, ranging from books to online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses (MOOCS)
like Codecademy and Coursera.

While this is great, Freshers and beginners find it difficult to rely on these resources and join private institutes only to get looted for hefty fees and empty promises. It can also be overwhelming for beginners -- there are almost
too many resources available, and it's difficult to figure out where to start.

This page is meant to help solve the problem -- to present a curated list of
resources for people who are either new to Java, new to a particular topic,
or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage. This page doesn't try and
list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are
guaranteed to be high-quality.
